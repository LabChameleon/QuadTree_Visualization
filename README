A simple visualization tool that shows how a quad tree datastructure can be used to partition a 2
dimensional space to allow for more efficient collision detection. The tool allows to specify the
depth of the quad tree and by holding the right mouse button and moving around, it visualizes if a
collision with the rectangle is possible or not.
